JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web content. It's commonly used in web development to add interactivity to web pages, create dynamic user interfaces, and manipulate the content of web pages in real time.

jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with JavaScript code in web development. It simplifies many common tasks, such as event handling, animation, and AJAX interactions with web servers. jQuery also provides a simplified syntax for working with the Document Object Model (DOM), which is the hierarchical structure of HTML and XML documents that underlie web pages.

Together, JavaScript and jQuery are commonly used to create rich, interactive web applications. They are essential tools for modern web development and are widely used by web developers around the world.
